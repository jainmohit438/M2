Problem statement
A modern problem that ever household faces when they move to a new city/society is that of finding a good, trustable and economically reasonable house-help.
Moving to some place new, we are bound not to know the going rates for the basic services that you might need as soon as you shift there.
Keeping this in mind, this mobile application has been created to act as the one true and final solution to all our household needs ranging from services such as
deep cleaning of your house to plumber or carpenter or electrician or spa or mental council or same city courier to even your computer or mobile repairs in the unfortunate 
event that they suffer some damage.Not only this, the app is also available to workers also who are in desperate need of jobs to earn for a living and be able
to feed their family at least 3 times a day. They can also take full advantage of this application and try to make ends meet.
